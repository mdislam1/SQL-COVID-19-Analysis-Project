/*
Covid-19 Data Analysis and Insights

This project focuses on analyzing Covid-19 data across various regions 
to understand the global impact of the virus, including case numbers, 
deaths, and vaccination coverage. The analysis utilizes two key datasets, 
CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations, loaded from Excel files into an SQLite 
database. The project calculates key metrics such as death percentages, 
the proportion of the population infected, and countries with the highest 
infection and mortality rates. It also tracks vaccination progress by 
calculating the percentage of the population vaccinated over time using
rolling counts, employing advanced SQL techniques like window functions, 
CTEs, and temporary tables for efficient data manipulation.

The output of the project provides valuable insights into the global 
pandemicâ€™s impact and the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns. 
It includes data on Covid-19 case and death numbers, as well as 
vaccination coverage by country and continent. Advanced queries and 
optimizations ensure that the data is processed efficiently, even with
large datasets. The final result is a structured and optimized SQL setup 
that enables easy visualization of Covid-19 trends and supports 
data-driven decisions in public health responses.

-- 1. Data Quality Check: Ensure no NULL values in critical columns
SELECT * FROM CovidDeaths WHERE total_cases IS NULL OR total_deaths IS NULL;
SELECT * FROM CovidVaccinations WHERE new_vaccinations IS NULL;

-- 2. Create necessary indices for better performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_location_date ON CovidDeaths(location, date);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_vaccination_location_date ON CovidVaccinations(location, date);

-- 3. Selecting the initial data
