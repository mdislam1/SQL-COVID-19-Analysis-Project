# COVID-19 Data Analysis and Insights

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing COVID-19 data across various regions to understand the global impact of the virus, including case numbers, deaths, and vaccination coverage. The analysis utilizes two key datasets, `CovidDeaths` and `CovidVaccinations`, loaded from Excel files into an SQLite database. The project calculates key metrics such as death percentages, the proportion of the population infected, and countries with the highest infection and mortality rates. It also tracks vaccination progress by calculating the percentage of the population vaccinated over time using rolling counts, employing advanced SQL techniques like window functions, CTEs, and temporary tables for efficient data manipulation.

The output of the project provides valuable insights into the global pandemicâ€™s impact and the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns. It includes data on COVID-19 case and death numbers, as well as vaccination coverage by country and continent. Advanced queries and optimizations ensure that the data is processed efficiently, even with large datasets. The final result is a structured and optimized SQL setup that enables easy visualization of COVID-19 trends and supports data-driven decisions in public health responses.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/covid-19-data-analysis.git
   cd covid-19-data_analysis_and_insights
   ```

2. **Set Up SQLite Database:**
   - Ensure you have SQLite installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://sqlite.org/download.html).
   - Load your COVID-19 datasets (`CovidDeaths.xlsx` and `CovidVaccinations.xlsx`) into an SQLite database. You can use tools like [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) to import the data.

3. **Install Required Tools:**
   - Ensure you have a SQL client or command-line tool to run SQL scripts.

## Usage

1. **Run the SQL Scripts:**
   - Open your SQL client or command-line tool.
   - Connect to your SQLite database.
   - Run the provided SQL scripts to perform the analysis.

2. **Execute the Scripts:**
   - You can run the entire script at once or execute individual queries to perform specific analyses.

### Data Analysis

The SQL scripts perform a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data, including:

1. **Data Quality Check**: Ensure no NULL values in critical columns.
2. **Index Creation**: Optimize database performance with necessary indices.
3. **Initial Data Selection**: Extract key data for analysis.
4. **Total Cases vs Total Deaths**: Calculate the likelihood of death from COVID-19.
5. **Total Cases vs Population**: Determine the percentage of the population infected.
6. **Infection and Death Rates**: Identify countries and continents with the highest infection and death rates.
7. **Vaccination Progress**: Track vaccination coverage using rolling counts and population percentages.
8. **Advanced Techniques**: Utilize CTEs, temporary tables, and views for efficient data manipulation.
9. **Data Optimization**: Refactor queries, handle time zones, and ensure data completeness.
10. **Performance Testing**: Use EXPLAIN for query optimization and index tuning.

This analysis provides insights into the global impact of COVID-19, vaccination effectiveness, and supports data-driven public health decisions.
